According to Carl Jung there are 4 polar dimensions:
	Extraverted  (E) vs. (I) Introverted
	Sensing	     (S) vs. (N) Intuition
	Feeling      (F) vs. (T) Thinking
	Judging      (J) vs. (P) Perceiving

1. E vs. I
	Extraverts project their energy on the external world. They are more socially active and grow
	through interaction.
 	Introverts have as source of energy their internal world. Usualy quiet and reserved, they analyse in 
	depth their actions.
2. S vs. N
	Sensitive people are pragmatic. They pay more attention to physical reality, are concerned with the present and look for practical applications of what they're learning.
	Intuitive people are theoretical. Tehy pay attention to patterns, look for meaning in the information they learn and are more concerned about the past and the future.
3. F vs. T
	People who use Feeling when deciding, usually base their decisions on personal preferences and on the
points-of-view of other persons involved in the situation.
	Thinkers are logical. They base their decisions on truth and principles dettached from any specific setting. 
4. J vs. P
	Judgers like things to be organized and planned in advance. They feel most comfortable when everything is secured and under control and are usually reticent to new experiences.
	Perceivers are flexible and spontaneous. They prefer to understand and adapt rather than organize and are open to new experiences.
